# Plan for Implementing Piece Movement

1.  **Modify `ChessBoard.jsx`:**
    *   Add `onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, and `onDrop` event handlers to the `Square` component.
    *   The `onDragStart` handler will be responsible for storing the data of the piece being dragged.
    *   The `onDragOver` handler will prevent the default behavior of the browser, which is to not allow dropping.
    *   The `onDrop` handler will be responsible for updating the board state when a piece is dropped on a new square.

2.  **Update `Board.jsx`:**
    *   Create a function to handle the piece movement logic.
    *   This function will be passed down to the `ChessBoard` component as a prop.
    *   The function will update the `chessBoard` state when a piece is moved.

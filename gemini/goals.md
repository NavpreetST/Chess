The main goal of this project is to create a fully functional chess application. This includes the following:

- **Interactive Chessboard:** Users should be able to move pieces on the board.
- **Legal Move Validation:** The application should only allow legal moves.
- **Game State Management:** The application should keep track of the game state, including whose turn it is, castling rights, and en passant.
- **Database Integration:** The application should use a database to store games and user data.
- **Online Multiplayer:** Users should be able to play against each other online.
- **User Accounts:** Users should be able to create accounts and track their progress.

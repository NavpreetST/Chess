# Project Summary

This is a React-based chess application. The goal is to create an interactive chessboard where users can play chess. The project is built with Vite and uses React for the frontend.

## Current State

- The application renders a chessboard using React components.
- The initial board position is loaded from a FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string.
- There is a form to input a FEN string and update the board.
- The pieces are displayed on the board, but they are not yet interactive.

## Future Goals

- Implement piece movement.
- Implement legal move validation.
- Add a database to store games and user data.
- Implement online multiplayer functionality.
- Create user accounts and profiles.
